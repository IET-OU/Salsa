      <h3>Forming the passive</h3>

      <p>In passive sentences, the object of the action becomes the subject of the sentence. We choose active or passive depending on what we are most interested in.</p>

  		<div class="example">
    		<p><i>Active:</i> Some of the landscapes really impress me.</p>
    		<p><i>Passive:</i> I am really impressed by some of the landscapes.</p>
  		</div>


      <p>In this sentence, <i>I</i> is the subject of the sentence, but is also the person that is affected by the verb <i>impressed</i>. <i>Landscapes</i> are doing the action (impressing) but they are not the subject.</p>

      <p>Forming the passive is very simple. It is formed using the right person and tense of <b>to be + past participle</b>.</p>

		  <div class="example">
  			<p><i>Present simple</i>: I am fascinated by these portraits.</p>
  			<p><i>Past simple</i>: He was bored by the art gallery.</p>
  			<p><i>Past perfect</i>: The painting had been painted by a talented artist.</p>
  			<p><i>Future</i>: A new painting will be brought to the gallery on Monday.</p>
			</div>

      <p>To learn more about how and when to use the passive, see <a href="../7_at_the_leisure_centre/language.html">Activity 7</a>.</p>

      <h3>Practice</h3>

      <p>Make these active sentences passive. You can do them in your head, and then check your answers.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Everybody loved the painting.</li>
        <li>The artist makes his sculptures out of metal.</li>
        <li>A hundred people visited the gallery today.</li>
        <li>The new exhibition at the gallery will really impress you.</li>
        <li>The artist designed the MK Rose to have the structure of a flower.</li>
      </ol>
