      <p><b>Erica:</b> So, how did you find it? What did you like most?</p>

      <p><b>Andrei:</b> Well I’m glad I came but to be honest, looking at art like that <a href="language.html#idioms">isn’t really my cup of tea</a>. I was quite bored by it.</p>

      <p><b>Erica: </b>What? Bored? I thought it was amazing! The paintings were so beautiful. She is such a skillful artist. I was really <a href="vocab.html#impress">impressed</a> by some of the <a href="vocab.html#landscape">landscapes</a> she painted and I was fascinated by her <a href="vocab.html#portrait">portraits</a>.</p>

      <p><b>Andrei:</b> Really? I wasn’t that excited by it. <a href="vocab.html#see_the_point">I don’t see the point</a> of art. I mean, what’s so special about it? Isn’t it just people drawing pictures of what they see?</p>

      <p><b>Erica:</b> I’m not sure I agree with that. For me, art expresses emotion, beauty and personality. That’s why I think artists are so <a href="vocab.html#talented">talented</a>. They can do all that with just a picture.</p>

      <p><b>Andrei:</b> Well that maybe so, but I still think art is <a href="vocab.html#overrated">overrated</a>. People just go to art galleries so they can talk about it and look intelligent. They say ‘look how the artist is saying this’, and, ‘look how he means this’, but really he never meant any of it. It’s all just <a href="vocab.html#make_up">made up</a>!</p>

      <p><b>Erica:</b> I see what you’re saying, Andrei, but I think you’re missing the point. Art is personal. It can mean to you whatever you want it to mean. Surely its job is to make you think and talk about it. Even if the artist meant something different.</p>

      <p><b>Andrei:</b> I take your point, but you haven’t <a href="vocab.html#convince">convinced</a> me!</p>

      <p><b>Erica:</b> Haha ok. Let’s just <a href="language.html#idioms">agree to disagree</a>, shall we? Now, we’re near Campbell Park and I <a href="vocab.html#fancy_doing">fancy</a> seeing the MK Rose. Would you like to come too?</p>

      <p><b>Andrei:</b> Maybe, what is it?</p>

      <p><b>Erica:</b> It’s an outdoor <a href="vocab.html#sculpture">sculpture</a>. It’s like a <a href="vocab.html#monument">monument</a>. It has a mathematical design, like a flower.</p>

      <p><b>Andrei:</b> Haha, that sounds like art to me! I think I’ll <a href="language.html#idioms">give it a miss</a>.</p>

      <p><b>Erica:</b> Ok, fair enough. I’ll go with Maria. See you next week!</p>
