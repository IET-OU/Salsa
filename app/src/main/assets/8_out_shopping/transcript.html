        <p>I saw a jumper in a shop, when I was out with Maria, that I really liked. It was a <a href="vocab.html#bargain">bargain</a> as well. I had no time to try it on so I decided to take a risk and just buy it!</p>

        <p>But when I got it home, I tried it on and actually, I was disappointed. It didn’t look good on me because the fit wasn’t quite right, “That’s it,” I said, “I’m taking it back to the shop.”</p>

        <p>“Hi, could I return this jumper please.” I said to the girl at the <a href="vocab.html#till">till</a>.</p>

        <p>“Would you like a <a href="vocab.html#refund">refund</a> or <a href="vocab.html#exchange">exchange</a>?” she asked.</p>

        <p>“I’d like a <a href="vocab.html#refund">refund</a> please.”</p>

        <p>“What’s the problem? Is it <a href="vocab.html#faulty">faulty</a> or damaged?”</p>

        <p>“No, it’s fine. I just don't like the fit.”</p>

        <p> “And have you got the receipt and the <a href="vocab.html#tags">tags</a>?”</p>

        <p>“The receipt?” I said. “Yes I have. Just a second.” Fortunately I found it at the bottom of my bag. Then there was a problem.</p>

        <p>“Oh, I’ve just noticed that you bought this item in the sale,” she said. “I’m afraid we don’t offer refunds on sale items.”</p>

        <p>‘Oh no!’ I thought. ‘<a href="language.html#just_my_luck">Just my luck</a>. The one time I take a risk with buying clothes and they won’t let me return it!’</p>

        <p>“Can you tell me what I can do then?” I asked. “Can I exchange it?”</p>

        <p>“Yes I can let you exchange it for another item,” she said. “Or I can give you <a href="vocab.html#store_credit">store credit</a>. I can give you a <a href="vocab.html#voucher">voucher</a> for the value of your jumper and you can spend it at the store any time.”</p>

        <p>“Ok. <a href="language.html#short_on_time">I’m short on time now</a>. Is it alright if I take the <a href="vocab.html#store_credit">store credit</a>?” I asked.</p>

        <p>“Of course, I’ll just put that <a href="vocab.html#transaction">transaction</a> through the machine. Is there anything else I can help you with today?”</p>

        <p>I said no.</p>

        <p>“Can I interest you in <a href="vocab.html#sign_up">signing up</a> for a <a href="vocab.html#loyalty_card">loyalty card</a> so you receive all our best offers?”</p>

        <p>She passed some forms to me. I looked at them. ‘I know what this is,’ I thought. ‘It’s one of those things where I give them all my details so they can send me emails every week. I don’t want that.’</p>

        <p>I <a href="vocab.html#decline">declined</a>. “I'm alright, but thank you,” I said.</p>

        <p>“Are you sure? It won’t take a minute.”</p>

        <p>“Sorry, thanks, but I’m afraid I’m not interested”.</p>
