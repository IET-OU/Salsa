      <h2>Language tips</h2>

      <h3>I’m afraid</h3>

      <p>It’s very common in English to hear people say “I’m afraid…” or “I’m afraid that…”</p>

      <p>Look at the examples in Erica’s story.</p>

      <div class="example">
      	<p>I’m afraid we don’t offer refunds on sale items.</p>
        <p>Sorry, thanks, but I’m afraid I’m not interested.</p>
      </div>

      <p>Obviously this has nothing to do with being scared. What do you think the speakers mean when they say “I’m afraid…”?</p>

      <h3>Saying no</h3>

      <p>At the end of her story, Erica has to say that she doesn’t want something. She says:</p>

      <div class="example">
        <p>“I'm alright, but thank you.”</p>
      </div>

      <p>It is important to say ‘no’ to something politely. Here are some common ways to do this in English.</p>

      <h4>Informal</h4>

      <p>"Can I get you a cup of tea?"</p>

      <div class="example">
        <p>I’m alright, but thank you.</p>
        <p>No I’m fine, thanks.</p>
        <p>No thanks, it’s ok.</p>
        <p>Not just now, thanks.</p>
        <p>I think I’ll pass, but thank you!</p>
      </div>

      <h4>Formal</h4>

      <p>"Would you like a cup of tea?"</p>

      <div class="example">
        <p>That’s very kind of you, but no thanks.</p>
        <p>I’d rather not, but thank you.</p>
        <p>Perhaps not today.</p>
        <p>Maybe another time.</p>
        <p>Thank you for asking, but I’ll pass this time.</p>
      </div>

      <h4>Giving reasons</h4>

      <p>It is also good to give a reason when you say no to an invitation or offer.</p>

      <p>"Would you like to come to the shop with me?"</p>

      <div class="example">
        <p>I’d rather not because…</p>
        <p>I’d love to but I can’t because…</p>
        <p>I’m afraid not, I have to…</p>
        <p>Sorry, I wish I could but today I’m…</p>
      </div>

      <h3>Idioms</h3>

      <p>An idiom is a group of words whose meaning is different from what you would expect. Erica uses two nice idioms in her story.</p>


      <div class="vocab">

        <a id="just_my_luck"></a>
        <h4>Just my luck!</h4>
        <p>I’m so unlucky!</p>
        <p class="example">I went to the shop on Sunday morning but it was closed – just my luck!</p>

        <a id="short_on_time"></a>
        <h4>I’m short on time</h4>
        <p>I don’t have much time to do this.</p>
        <p class="example">I should have tried on the jumper, but I was short on time.</p>
