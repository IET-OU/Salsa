    <figcaption>This sculpture was Commissioned by The Open University to celebrate 40 years of providing open and equal educational opportunities to thousands of people. It has two androgynous people with their heads inclined towards each other. They could be anybody, any colour, any ability. They are enquiring and interested about our links worldwide and our wonder of it.
