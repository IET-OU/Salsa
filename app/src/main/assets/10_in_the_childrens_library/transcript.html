      <p>On Tuesday morning I took Maria to a children’s activity at the library. ‘Nursery rhymes and songs for the under 3s’, it was called. Maria loved it, especially the music. She also loved playing with the other children. She found it really <a href="vocab.html#exciting">exciting</a>.</p>

      <p>At the end of the session, I was ready to go home but Maria was still playing with another little girl. “Come on, Maria. It’s time to go home,” I said.</p>

      <p>“No!” she said, and she <a href="vocab.html#carry_on">carried on</a> playing.</p>

      <p>Then the mother of the other girl <a href="vocab.html#turn_up">turned up</a>. She smiled and said hello.</p>

      <p>“They’re getting on well, aren’t they?” she said.</p>

      <p>“Yeah they are,” I said. “They’re going to be good friends, <a href="vocab.html#i_can_tell">I can tell</a>. Do you come here often?” I asked. “This is our first time.”</p>

      <p>“This is our first time too,” she replied. “Normally we go to the <a href="vocab.html#playgroup">playgroup</a> near Campbell Park. They have great things for toddlers there and they give you loads of help and advice about <a href="vocab.html#childcare">childcare</a> as well. There is even a <a href="vocab.html#health_visitor">health visitor</a>.”</p>

      <p>“Sounds great,” I said. “I’d love to take Maria.”</p>

      <p>“Well, you should come!” she said. “How about you come with us next Tuesday. I can introduce you to everyone and Maria can make more friends.”</p>

      <p>“Ok, that would be great. I’d like that. Really kind of you to offer.”</p>

      <p>“Hey, don’t mention it,” she said. “Happy to help.”</p>

      <p>Then Maria suddenly grabbed a toy from the other girl. The girl started crying.</p>

      <p>“Maria!” I said loudly. “Don’t do that, it’s not yours!” I was so <a href="vocab.html#embarrassed">embarrassed</a>. “I’m so sorry!” I said to the girl’s mother. “She isn’t normally like that. She must be a bit over-excited today. Maria, say you’re sorry! Is she alright?”</p>

      <p>“Don’t worry about it,” said the girl’s mother. “She’s fine. You’re just <a href="vocab.html#make_a_fuss">making a fuss</a>, aren’t you Jessie? It’s alright.”</p>

      <p>She gave her daughter a cuddle and the little girl stopped crying. I made Maria <a href="vocab.html#apologise">apologise</a> and give the toy back.</p>

      <p>“Oh no, it’s fine, she can borrow the toy. Jessie doesn’t need it anyway. Maria can bring it to the <a href="vocab.html#playgroup">playgroup</a> next week.”</p>

      <p>“Oh, thank you so much,” I said. “That’s so kind. So, I’ll see you next week!”</p>
