      <h2>4 Language tips</h2>

      <h3>Patterns of conversation</h3>
      
      <p>Read Erica's conversation with the old woman again. Think about the pattern of the conversation.</p>

      <p>Does it go like this?</p>

      <p class="example">Question-Answer-Question-Answer</p>
      
       <p>No. A conversation is not normally like that. Social conversations have a more varied structure.</p>
       <p>Erica's conversation has a structure more like this:</p>

      <p class="example">Ask-Answer-Add-Ask</p>
      <p class="example"><b>Old lady</b>: "What's her name?" - ASK
      <br><b>Erica</b>: "Her name is Maria" - ANSWER
      <br><b>Old lady</b>: "She's adorable! She looks just like you. - ADD
      <br><b>Erica</b>: "Thank you. Do you have children yourself?" - ASK</p>
      
      <p>Think about how you can maintain conversations in English with patterns like this. This way, both people ask questions and both people answer questions.</p>    
      
      <h4>Icebreakers</h4>
      
      <p>'To break the ice' is an expression in English that means to start a conversation with someone that you don't know.</p>

      <p>In Erica's story, the old woman 'breaks the ice' by talking about Erica's baby.</p>

      <p>There are lots of ways to start a conversation, but here are a few useful phrases.</p>
	  
      <ul class="example">
        <li>Do you mind if I join you?</li>
        <li>How's it going?</li>
        <li>How has your day been?</li>
        <li>Are you from around here?</li>
        <li>I was wondering if you could help me.</li>
        <li>Do you come here often?</li>
        <li>Do you know if...?</li>
      </ul>

      <p>And of course, English people love talking about the weather so you can always start with...</p>

      <p class="example">Terrible weather today, isn't it!?</p>
