      <h3>Patterns of conversation</h3>
      
      <p>Read Erica's conversation with the old woman again. Think about the pattern of the conversation.</p>

      <p>Does it go like this?</p>

      <div class="example">
       Question-Answer-Question-Answer
      </div>
      
       <p>No. A conversation is not normally like that. Social conversations have a more varied structure.</p>
       <p>Erica's conversation has a structure more like this:</p>

      <div class="example">
       Ask-Answer-Add-Ask
       <p>Old lady: "What's her name?" - ASK
<br />Erica: "Her name is Maria" - ANSWER
<br />Old lady: "She's adorable! She looks just like you. - ADD
<br />Erica: "Thank you. Do you have children yourself?" - ASK
</p>
      </div>
      
  <p>Think about how you can maintain conversations in English with patterns like this. This way, both people ask questions and both people answer questions.</p>    
      
       <h4>Icebreakers</h4>
      
          <p>'To break the ice' is an expression in English that means to start a conversation with someone that you don't know.</p>

<p>In Erica's story, the old woman 'breaks the ice' by talking about Erica's baby.</p>

<p>There are lots of ways to start a conversation, but here are a few useful phrases.
</p>
	  
	        <div class="example">
Do you mind if I join you?
<br />How's it going?
<br />How has your day been?
<br />Are you from around here?
<br />I was wondering if you could help me.
<br />Do you come here often?
<br />Do you know if...?
</div>
<p>And of course, English people love talking about the weather so you can always start with...</p>
<div class="example">
Terrible weather today, isn't it!?
