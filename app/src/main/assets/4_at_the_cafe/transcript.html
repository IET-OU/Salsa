      <p>I took my baby Maria to a café today because I needed to use the internet. I ordered a cup of coffee from the <a href="vocab.html#counter">counter</a>.</p>

      <p>"To drink in here or take away?" the girl behind the counter asked. "Drink in here please," I said, "because I'd like to use the internet. Do you have free wifi here?"</p>

      <p>"Yes of course," she said. "You get one hour of <a href="vocab.html#complimentary">complimentary</a> wifi."</p>

      <p>I went across the café towards the only free table. There wasn't much room for Maria's pram.</p> 

      <p>"Could I just <a href="vocab.html#squeeze">squeeze</a> through please?" I asked as I went. "Sorry, could you just please move your chair for me? Thanks." People in the café got up and moved their chairs for me so I could <a href="vocab.html#reach">reach</a> the table. </p>

      <p>Then I remembered - I couldn't log into the wifi because I had forgotten to get the password.</p>

      <p>So back I went across the café to the <a href="vocab.html#counter">counter</a>. "Excuse me. Could you give me the wifi password, please?"</p> 

      <p>The girl had already written it down for me. She <a href="vocab.html#hand">handed</a> me a piece of paper and smiled.</p>

      <p>"That's great," I said. "What's the network name?"</p>

      <p>"It's 'cafelamimosa', all one word, all <a href="vocab.html#lowercase">lowercase</a>," she said.</p>

      <p>I looked on my phone. "Thanks, I've got it," I said.</p>

      <p>I went back over to our table. Fortunately, Maria had not woken up. She was still quiet. Then an elderly lady came over to our table. She had noticed little Maria and wanted a closer look.</p>

      <p>"Hi, oh she's so sweet!" she said. "Hello, little one! What's her name?"</p>

      <p>"Her name is Maria," I replied. "She's a year old. "</p>

      <p>Then Maria woke up. She opened her eyes and smiled.</p>

      <p> "Oh how adorable!" continued the lady. "She looks just like you."</p>

      <p>"Thank you, that's very kind of you," I said. "Do you have children yourself?" I asked.</p>

      <p>"Oh yes, I have three children. I even have grandchildren now. She must be your first child?"</p>

      <p>"Yes she is my first. She is very special."</p>

      <p>"I'm sure she is," said the lady. "Well, <a href="vocab.html#be_off">I must be off</a>. <a href="vocab.html#lovely">Lovely</a> talking to you. Have a nice day. All the best to you both."</p>

      <p>I smiled. "Same to you," I said. Then she left the café.</p>
