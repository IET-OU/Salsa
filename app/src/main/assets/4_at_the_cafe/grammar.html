      <h2>3 Grammar</h2>

      <h3>Past perfect</h3>
    
      <p>Read or listen to the text again. Notice the use of verb tenses like this:</p>
        
      <p class="example">“I remembered I had forgotten to get the wifi password.”</p>
      <p class="example">“The girl had already written it down for me.”</p>
      <p class="example">“Maria had not woken up.”</p>

      <p>This tense is called the past perfect. It is formed with the past simple of have -  <b>had + past participle</b>.</p>

      <p>When we talk about an event that happened in the past we use the past simple (I remembered). When we talk about an event that happened before that time, we need to use the past perfect (had forgotten). For example: </p>

      <p class="example">Tense: Past perfect
      <br />Form:  had + past participle
      <br />Use: To say which of two past actions or events happened first/An action in the past completed before another action in the past.</p>

      <p>Often, the past perfect appears with 'already'.</p>
      
      <p class="example">“The girl had already written it down for me.”</p>


      <h3>Practice</h3>
