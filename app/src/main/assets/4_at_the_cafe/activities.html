      <h2>5 Activities</h2>

      <img src="../images/4_image_3.jpg" class="bg-img">

      <h3>Activity 1</h3>
      
      <p>The next time you are in a café or shop, try to start a conversation with the person at the counter.</p>
      
      <p>Start by asking something like:</p>

      <p class="example">"How has your day been?"</p>
      
      <p>He or she will say something like:</p>
      
      <p class="example">"Ok thanks. How about yours?"</p>
   
      <p>Then you can tell them about your day!</p>

      <h3>Activity 2</h3>

      <p>If you are sitting in a café, listen to the conversations around you. See if you can understand what people are talking about by listening for key words.</p>
      
      <p>Think about the pattern of their conversation. Is it question-answer-question-answer?</p>

      <h3>Activity 3</h3>

      <p>Tell a story in English to someone you know. Like Erica, it could be about something interesting that happened in your day..</p>

      <p>Try to use a verb in the past perfect (had done). Remember, the past perfect is for events that happen before the main events in your story.</p>
