      <h2>5 Activities</h2>

      <!-- <img src="../images/2_image_3.jpg" width="100%"> -->

      <h3>Activity 1</h3>
      
      <p>The next time you are in a caf&#233; or shop, try to start a conversation with the person at the counter.</p>
      
      <p>Start by asking something like:</p>

      <div class="example">
   "How has your day been?"
      </div>
      
       <p>He or she will say something like:</p>
            <div class="example">
 "Ok thanks. How about yours?"
      </div>
   
       <p>Then you can tell them about your day!</p>


            <h3>Activity 2</h3>

      <p>If you are sitting in a caf&#233;, listen to the conversations around you. See if you can understand what people are talking about by listening for key words.</p>
      
      <p>Think about the pattern of their conversation. Is it question-answer-question-answer?</p>

      <h3>Activity 3</h3>

      <p>Tell a story in English to someone you know. Like Erica, it could be about something interesting that happened in your day..</p>

      <p>Try to use a verb in the past perfect (had done). Remember, the past perfect is for events that happen before the main events in your story.</p>
