      <h2>3 Grammar</h2>

      <h3>Tenses and reported speech</h3>
    
      <p>Reported speech is when we talk about something that somebody said in the past. We usually change the tense of the verb.</p>
          
      <p>There are lots of examples of reported speech in Erica's story.</p>
      
      <div class="example">
        <ul>
          <li>She said we could take the bus.</li>
          <li>I told him I would just buy a single.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p>What were the words that were actually said?</p>
      
      <div class="example">
        <ul>
          <li>We can take the bus</li>
          <li>I will just buy a single.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

<p>Now read the story again and look for more examples of reported speech. Can you find them all?

<h3>Answers</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>She said we could take the bus.</li>
          <li>I told him I didn't want to go that way.</li>
          <li>I thought I was pronouncing the name wrong.</li>
          <li>I told him I would just buy a single.</li>
        </ul>



      <p>Look at the way she uses tenses.</p>
      
      <div class="example">
        <ul>
          <li>can --&gt; could</li>
          <li>don't want --&gt; didn't want</li>
          <li>am pronouncing --&gt; was pronouncing</li>
        	<li>will --&gt; would</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p>When you report speech, you usually use a tense that is 'more past' than the words that were actually said. For example:</p>
      
      <div class="example">
        <ul>
          <li>present simple --&gt; past simple</li>
          <li>past simple --&gt; past perfect</li>
          <li>present perfect --&gt; past perfect</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
