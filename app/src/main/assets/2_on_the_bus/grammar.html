      <h3>Tenses and reported speech</h3>
    
      <p>Reported speech is when we talk about something that somebody said in the past. We usually change the tense of the verbs.</p>
          
      <p>There are lots of examples of reported speech in Erica's story.</p>
      
      <div class="example">
          <p>She said we could take the bus.</p>
          <p>I told him I would just buy a single.</p>
      </div>

      <p>What were the words that were actually said?</p>
      
      <div class="example">
        <p>We can take the bus.</p>
        <p>I will just buy a single.</p>
      </div>

      <p>Now read the story again and look for more examples of reported speech. Can you find them all?

      <p>Look at the way she uses tenses.</p>
      
      <div class="example">
        <p>can --&gt; could</p>
        <p>don't want --&gt; didn't want</p>
        <p>am pronouncing --&gt; was pronouncing</p>
      	<p>will --&gt; would</p>
      </div>

      <p>When you report speech, you usually use a tense that is 'more past' than the words that were actually said. For example:</p>
      
      <div class="example">
        <p>present simple --&gt; past simple</p>
        <p>past simple --&gt; past perfect</p>
        <p>present perfect --&gt; past perfect</p>
      </div>

      <h3>Practice</h3>

      <p>Try to turn these sentences into reported speech. Pay attention to verb tenses.</p>

      <div class="vocab">
        <p><b>Example:</b> I understand the bus driver.</p>
        <p class="example">I said I understood the bus driver.</p>
      </div>

      <ol>
        <li>I know which bus to take.</li>
        <li>I have had a bad day.</li>
        <li>I am really struggling with the pram.</li>
        <li>I will take the bus to the hospital instead.</li>
        <li>I can't get to your house.</li>
      </ol>
