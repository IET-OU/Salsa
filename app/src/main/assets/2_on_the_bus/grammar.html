      <h2>3 Grammar</h2>

      <h3>Tenses and reported speech</h3>
    
      <p>Reported speech is when we talk about something that somebody said in the past. We usually change the tense of the verb.</p>
          
      <p>There are lots of examples of reported speech in Erica's story.</p>
      
      <p class="example">She said we could take the bus.</p>
      <p class="example">I told him I would just buy a single.</p>

      <p>What were the words that were actually said?</p>
      
      <p class="example">We can take the bus</p>
      <p class="example">I will just buy a single.</p>

      <p>Now read the story again and look for more examples of reported speech. Can you find them all?

      <h3>Answers</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>She said we could take the bus.</li>
        <li>I told him I didn't want to go that way.</li>
        <li>I thought I was pronouncing the name wrong.</li>
        <li>I told him I would just buy a single.</li>
      </ul>



      <p>Look at the way she uses tenses.</p>
      
      <p class="example">can --&gt; could</p>
      <p class="example">don't want --&gt; didn't want</p>
      <p class="example">am pronouncing --&gt; was pronouncing</p>
    	<p class="example">will --&gt; would</p>

      <p>When you report speech, you usually use a tense that is 'more past' than the words that were actually said. For example:</p>
      
      <p class="example">present simple --&gt; past simple</p>
      <p class="example">past simple --&gt; past perfect</p>
      <p class="example">present perfect --&gt; past perfect</p>

      <h3>Practice</h3>

      <p>Try to turn these sentences into reported speech. Pay attention to verb tenses. The answers are at the bottom of the page.</p>

      <p class="example"><b>Example</b>: I understand the bus driver. --&gt; I said I understood the bus driver.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>I know which bus to take.</li>
        <li>I have had a bad day.</li>
        <li>I am really struggling with the pram.</li>
        <li>I will take the bus to the hospital instead.</li>
        <li>I can't get to your house.</li>
      </ol>
