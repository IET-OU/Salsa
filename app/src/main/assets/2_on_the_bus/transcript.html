      <p>Getting around the UK can be so frustrating sometimes. Today I tried to visit a friend of a friend from back home. She had offered to help us settle in to Milton Keynes. She said we could take the bus but I wasn't sure which route to take. When a bus came along, I got on through the front door with the pram so I could ask the driver for help.

      <p>"Excuse me", I said, "I would like to get to <a href="vocab.html#broughton">Broughton</a>. Is this the right bus?"</p>

      <p>"'Fraid not," said the bus driver, "You want to get on the hospital bus to get to <a href="vocab.html#woughton">Wroughton</a>."</p>

      <p>"To the hospital? That can't be right." I said. I thought that maybe I was pronouncing the name wrong. So I tried again.</p> 

      <p>"Sorry," I said, “perhaps I meant <a href="vocab.html#broughton">Broughton</a>."</p>

      <p>"<a href="vocab.html#loughton">Loughton</a>?" he replied. "No, Loughton's over by the railway station. I'm going the other way."</p>

      <p>'What? But I know where the railway station is!' I thought. I told him that I didn't want to go to that way.</p> 

      <p>"Hang on one moment," I said, and I looked in my handbag. I managed to find a piece of paper with the woman's address on. I showed it to the driver. "Look, I want to go here, <a href="vocab.html#broughton">Broughton</a>. Do you know where it is?"</p>

      <p>"Oh, you mean <a href="vocab.html#broughton">Broughton</a>, do you?" said the driver.</p>

      <p>"I don't know. Do I?" I replied. "I'm confused. I have no idea any more!"</p>

      <p>"Is it over by the motorway?" asked the driver.</p>

      <p>"Yes that's it!" I said. "She told me she lives near the motorway."</p>

      <p>"That'll be <a href="vocab.html#broughton">Broughton</a> then," said the bus driver. "You had me confused there. You see," he went on, "we've got <a href="vocab.html#woughton">Woughton</a>, <a href="vocab.html#loughton">Loughton</a>, and <a href="vocab.html#broughton">Broughton</a> and they're all spelled the same, just pronounced differently."</p>

      <p>“Oh, I see,” I said. I finally realised what the problem was. “You thought <i>you</i> were confused – what about me?! I’m new here. How am I supposed to know that?”</p>

<p>“You’ll learn, don’t worry,” he laughed. “If you’re not sure, just ask.”</p>

<p>“Thanks. That’s very kind. So how much is a ticket to... where am I going again?"</p>

      <p>"<a href="vocab.html#broughton">Broughton</a>."</p>

      <p>"<a href="vocab.html#broughton">Broughton</a>! How much is a ticket to <a href="vocab.html#broughton">Broughton</a>?"</p>

      <p>"£2.20 for a single, or £4.20 for a day ticket", he said.</p>

      <p>I told him I would just buy a single.</p>
