      <h3>Activity 1</h3>
      
      <p>Read the signs on the bus or around the bus stop. Take notice of some of the language constructions and think about them.</p>

      <p>Here are some examples</p>

      <p class="example">Bus stopping</p>
      <p class="example">Mind the doors</p>
      <p class="example">Get on board</p>
      <p class="example">Concessionary fare</p>
      <p class="example">Passengers are reminded to take all their belongings with them.</p>
      <p class="example">This service is usually operated using a wheelchair accessible vehicle.</p>
      <p class="example">There is no guarantee that there will be space on a vehicle at any given time.</p>

      <p>Do you find the language you see easy to understand? If not, take some phrases to class and discuss them or look them up on the internet.</p>

      <h3>Activity 2</h3>

      <p>Tell a friend about a conversation that you had today. You will have to practise reported speech.</p>

      <p>For example:</p>

      <p class="example">The teacher said we had to...</p>
      <p class="example">I met a lady who said she was travelling to...</p>
