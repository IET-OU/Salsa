        <p><b>Receptionist</b>: Right, so thank you for visiting us. Let me <a href="vocab.html#take_you_through">take you through</a> using the pool. There is a swimming class every morning, which means you can’t swim unless you are taking lessons.</p>

        <p><b>Erica</b>: OK, so you mean I can only swim if I come in the afternoon.</p>

        <p><b>Receptionist</b>: That’s right. It’s recommended that you come around lunchtime or in the evening for public swimming.</p>

        <p><b>Erica</b>: And do you have something suitable for <a href="vocab.html#toddler">toddlers</a>? My daughter really likes water.</p>

        <p><b>Receptionist</b>: Yes that’s fine, we have a <a href="vocab.html#toddler">toddler</a> pool and she can come as long as she stays in it. Armbands and non-swimmers aren’t allowed in the main pool.</p>

        <p><b>Erica</b>: That’s ok. As long as she’s in the water, she’ll be happy!</p>

        <p><b>Receptionist</b>: Great. So, before using the pool, all swimmers are asked to use the showers.</p>

        <p><b>Erica</b>: Fine. And what about changing?</p>

        <p><b>Receptionist</b>: There are lots of options. You can get changed in the individual <a href="vocab.html#cubicle">cubicles</a> or, if you come with your daughter, the bigger family <a href="vocab.html#cubicle">cubicles</a> in the women’s changing rooms. Your <a href="vocab.html#belongings">belongings</a> and <a href="vocab.html#valuables">valuables</a> can be stored in the <a href="vocab.html#locker">lockers</a> once you’re ready to swim.</p>

        <p><b>Erica</b>: Thanks. That seems simple. So I want to come every week, I think. Can you tell me what the available discounts are? Is there a season ticket? Or maybe a family ticket?</p>

        <p><b>Receptionist</b>: I’m afraid family tickets are for four people or more, but you can buy a season pass that will give you free, <a href="vocab.html#unlimited_access">unlimited access</a> and one free <a href="vocab.html#session">session</a> per month, anywhere in the <a href="vocab.html#leisure">leisure</a> centre.</p>

        <p><b>Erica</b>: Great! I like the sound of that. What other activities can I do here?</p>

        <p><b>Receptionist</b>: Oh there’s a lot going on here: we have a gym, and offer fitness, aerobics, yoga, salsa classes…</p>

        <p><b>Erica</b>: Salsa dancing! I’ve always wanted to try salsa. So I <a href="vocab.html#get_to_do_something">get to do</a> that free once a month?</p>

        <p><b>Receptionist</b>: Yes, as long as you buy your season ticket.</p>

        <p><b>Erica</b>: Oh this is perfect – I hope the ticket isn’t too <a href="vocab.html#pricey">pricey</a>!</p>
