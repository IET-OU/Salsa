    <p>In this activity, Erica visits her local council offices to complain about some graffiti that has appeared on her street. She doesn't quite get the response she is hoping for though.</p>
    
    <p>You will learn how to politely make a request in a formal conversation, give information and understand how others are going to act on it.</p>


    
    <h3>Warm up</h3>
    
    <p>Think about the following important words that are associated with the council:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Councillor</li>
        <li>Local</li>
        <li>Community</li>
        <li>Facility</li>
        <li>Services</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Do you know the meaning of them all?</p>
    
    <p>Think about what it is that your council does for you. Compare what you know about your council in the UK with what there is in your home country.</p>

<h4>Activity</h4>
    
    <p>Write down in English all the things that you know your local council does for you. Compare your list with your classmates'.</p>
