      <h2>3 Grammar</h2>

      <h3>Phrasal verbs</h3>

      <p>Phrasal verbs are made up of a verb and a particle (little word e.g 'up'). Sometimes two particles. There are a lot of phrasal verbs in English and it is very difficult to learn them all. Sometimes it is easy to guess the meaning of phrasal verbs, sometimes it is impossible!</p>

      <p>It is important to know that there are different types of phrasal verb that work in different ways.</p>

      <p>There are three phrasal verbs in the dialogue:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Follow up</li>
        <li>Go about</li>
        <li>Put up with</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Separable phrasal verbs</h4>

      <p><b>Follow up</b> is a <i>separable</i> phrasal verb. This means that the verb and the particle can be separated in the sentence. The meaning is the same.</p>
      
      <p class="example">The council will <b>follow up</b> the complaint.</p>
      <p class="example">The council will <b>follow</b> the complaint <b>up</b>.</p>

      <p>However, if there is an object pronoun like <b>it</b>, the pronoun <i>must</i> go between the verb and the particle.</p>

      <p class="example">The council will follow <b>it</b> up.</p>

      <h4>Inseparable phrasal verbs</h4>

      <p><b>Go about</b> is an example of an inseparable phrasal verb. The verb and the particle must always be together in the sentence.</p>

      <p class="example">How do I <b>go about</b> making a complaint?<br>
      <b>NOT</b> How do I <b>go</b> making a complaint <b>about</b>?</p>

      <p>Some phrasal verbs, like <b>put up with</b> have two particles. These particles can <i>never</i> be separated from the verb and must always appear in the same order.</p>

      <p class="example">Must I <b>put up with</b> all this graffiti?<br>
      <b>NOT</b> Must I <b>put with</b> all this graffiti <b>up</b>?</p>

      <h3>Practice</h3>

      <p>Fill in the gaps in the sentence with option A, B or C. You can do this in your head. The answers are below.

        <li>Do you mind _______ for a few more days until we have the time to remove it? <i>(<b>A</b>: putting up it with <b>B</b>: putting with it up <b>C</b>: putting up with it)</i></li>
        <li>I just wanted to know if anyone has _______ on my message from last week. <i>(<b>A</b>: followed up - <b>B</b>: gone about - <b>C</b>: followed it up)</i></li>
      </ol>
