      <h3>Activity 1</h3>

      <p>Read the dialogue and the vocabulary again. It will help you complete the following useful phrases.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>I'm really sorry to ______ you.</li>
        <li>I would like to ______ a problem in my neighbourhood.</li>
        <li>How do I __ _____ making a complaint?</li>
        <li>Can you please ______ it __ soon?</li>
      </ol>

      <p>You can try to use these words and phrases in the next activities.</p>

      <h4>Answers</h4>

      <ol>
        <li>bother</li>
        <li>report</li>
        <li>go about</li>
        <li>follow it up</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Activity 2</h3>

      <p>Think about the word <a href="vocab.html#complaint">complaint</a>. In the dialogue it is used with different verbs (e.g <b>make</b> a complaint).</p>

      <p>Look at the <a href="dialogue.html">dialogue</a> again. What are these verbs? What do the phrases mean? How are they different to '<b>make</b> a complaint'?</p>


      <h3>Activity 3</h3>

      <p>Is something wrong in your area. Holes in the road? Unpleasant neighbours? Or maybe there aren’t enough facilities like parks for your children. Discuss the problems with a friend or neighbour. Or you could make some notes and discuss them in your next language class.</p>

      <h4>Internet only!</h4>

      <p>Look at the council’s <a href="http://www.milton-keynes.gov.uk/">website</a>. Decide whether the council can help you with your problem or not.</p>




      <h3>Activity 4 - internet only!</h3>
      <p>Are there any words or topics on the council’s <a href="http://www.milton-keynes.gov.uk/">website</a> that you don’t understand? Look them up, or take them to your next language class and find out their meaning.</p>
