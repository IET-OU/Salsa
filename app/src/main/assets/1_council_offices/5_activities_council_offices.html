<h3>Activity 1</h3>

<ol>
<li>I'm really sorry to ______ you.</li>
<li>I would like to ______ a problem in my neighbourhood.</li>
<li>How do I __ _____ making a complaint?</li>
<li>Can you please ______ it __ soon?</li>
</ol>

You can try to use these words and phrases in the next activities.

<h4>Answers</h4>
    <ol>
    <li>bother</li>
    <li>report</li>
    <li>go about</li>
    <li>follow it up</li>
    </ol>

<h3>Activity 2</h3>

<p>Think about something that is wrong in your area. It could be broken streetlights, holes in the road or unpleasant neighbours. Or maybe there aren’t enough facilities like parks for your children.</p>

<p>Make some notes and discuss them in your next language class. You can use the council’s <a href="http://www.milton-keynes.gov.uk/">website</a> to decide whether the council can help you with your problem or not.</p>


<h3>Activity 3</h3>

<p>Are there any words or topics on the council’s <a href="http://www.milton-keynes.gov.uk/">website</a> that you don’t understand? Look them up, or take them to your next language class and find out their meaning.</p>
