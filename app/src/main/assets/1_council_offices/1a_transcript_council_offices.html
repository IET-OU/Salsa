<p><b>Customer services</b>: Hello there, thank you for coming in. How can we help you today?</p>

    <p><b>Erica</b>: Hello, good morning. I’m sorry to <a href="2_vocab_council_offices.html#bother">bother</a> you but I would like to <a href="2_vocab_council_offices.html#report">report</a> some nasty <a href="2_vocab_council_offices.html#graffiti">graffiti</a> on my street. It’s right outside my house. How could I <a href="2_vocab_council_offices.html#go_about">go about</a> getting it removed?</p>

<p><b>Customer services</b>: Ok, if you leave the <a href="2_vocab_council_offices.html#complaint">complaint</a> with us we may be able to <a href="2_vocab_council_offices.html#follow_up">follow it</a> up within 24 hours if it’s an emergency. Can you describe it for me? Is it <a href="2_vocab_council_offices.html#obscene">obscene</a>, racist or religious in nature?</p>

<p><b>Erica</b>: No it isn’t really any of those, but it’s big and ugly and I don’t like the atmosphere it creates in my neighbourhood.</p>

<p><b>Customer services</b>: I’m sorry, if it isn’t <a href="2_vocab_council_offices.html#obscene">obscene</a> or offensive though then it doesn’t <a href="2_vocab_council_offices.html#count_as">count as</a> emergency <a href="2_vocab_council_offices.html#graffiti">graffiti</a>. I’m afraid we won’t be able to remove it immediately, but we will try to remove it as soon as we can.</p>

<p><b>Erica</b>: I see. That’s disappointing. I've been <a href="2_vocab_council_offices.html#put_up_with">putting up with</a> it for a very long time and I was hoping you could remove it soon.</p>

<p><b>Customer services</b>: I’m sorry we can’t do more. Obviously our cleaning teams are very busy. Bear with me please. I’ll take your details and <a href="2_vocab_council_offices.html#log">log</a> the <a href="2_vocab_council_offices.html#complaint">complaint</a> for you.</p>
