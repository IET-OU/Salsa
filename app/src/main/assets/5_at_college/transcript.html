        <p><b>Erica</b>: Hi, you're Andrei, aren't you? You <a href="vocab.html#join_a_class">joined our class</a> this week, didn't you? I'm Erica, nice to meet you.</p>

        <p><b>Andrei</b>: Hi Erica, yeah that's right. I'm the new boy in the class. It seems like a good course, doesn't it?</p>

        <p><b>Erica</b>: Yes, I've been doing it for a long time and I think it's great. <a href="vocab.html#how_about_you">What about you?</a> How long have you been learning English? Didn't you say you studied a lot before you came here?</p>

        <p><b>Andrei</b>: Yeah, I'd been studying for years in Poland before I came here. I learned enough to get a job as a <a href="vocab.html#mechanic">mechanic</a>. I <a href="vocab.html#get_a_degree">have a degree</a> in engineering from Poland but I moved here because the economy is good. I can work as a <a href="vocab.html#mechanic">mechanic</a> <a href="vocab.html#until">until</a> I know enough English to become an <a href="vocab.html#engineer">engineer</a> here.</p>

        <p><b>Erica</b>: Oh you've got a degree, have you? Wow, that's so good. As soon as I can I would love to <a href="vocab.html#get_a_degree">get a degree</a>, but it's been too difficult since I've had my little girl. Maybe one day. <a href="vocab.html#what_are_you_up_to">What have you been up to</a> this week? Weather’s been terrible, hasn’t it?</p>

        <p><b>Andrei</b>: Yeah, it's been awful, <a href="vocab.html#right">right?</a> I hate the British weather, don't you? It's so depressing! But I've been going out a bit anyway. Trying to get to know Milton Keynes. How about you?</p>

        <p><b>Erica</b>: Well, I've been really busy. <a href="vocab.html#obviously">Obviously</a> I'm looking after my baby. I've been trying to find a job as well. That's taken a lot of time.</p>

        <p><b>Andrei</b>: Yeah, it can't be easy with a little one, can it?</p>

        <p><b>Erica</b>: It's fine. I manage. Anyway, sorry, but I need to go. I'll see you next week, won't I? We can talk again then.</p>

        <p><b>Andrei</b>: Sure, we'll do that. See you soon!</p>
