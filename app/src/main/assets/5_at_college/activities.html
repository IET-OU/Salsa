      <h3>Activity 1</h3>

      <p>Find out something from someone in college. Ask them where they were born or what other courses they are doing.</p>

      <p>Think about using question tags to invite the person to comment or agree with you. It might help keep the conversation going.</p>


      <h3>Activity 2</h3>

      <p>Listen to people asking questions in English. Pay attention to the intonation they use.</p>

      <p>Listen out for question tags. Does the voice go up or go down at the end?</p>


      <h3>Activity 3</h3>

      <p>Look out for long words on signs, notices or posters around you. Guess how you pronounce them. Pay attention to where the stress goes.</p>

      <p>Write down a list, and then find out from somebody how to pronounce the words. Or you can use a dictionary to check pronunciation and stress.</p>

      <p>Did you get the stress in the right place?</p>
