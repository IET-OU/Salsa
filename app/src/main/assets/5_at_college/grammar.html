      <h3>Question tags</h3>

      <p>Read or listen to the dialogue again. There are several question tags.</p>

      <p>A question tag is a short question that we can add at the end of a statement. They appear most often in spoken English.</p>
      
      
      <div class="example">
        <p>You're Andrei, <b>aren't you?</b></p>
        <p>It seems like a good course, <b>doesn't it?</b></p>
        <p>I'll see you next week, <b>won't I?</b></p>
  		</div>

      <p>Forming question tags is easy. If there is one, use the auxiliary (be or have) or modal verb (can, must, would, should etc.).</p>
      
      
      <div class="example">
        <p>Weather’s been terrible, <b>has</b>n’t it?</p>
      </div>
      

      <p>If there isn't, make the tag with do.</p>
      
      <div class="example">
        <p>It seems like a good course, <b>does</b>n't it?</p>
      </div>

      <p>A positive statement has a negative tag.</p>
      
      <div class="example">
        <p>You joined our class this week, did<b>n't</b> you?</p>
      </div>

      <p>A negative statement has a positive tag.</p>

      <div class="example">
        <p>Yeah, it can't be easy with a little one, <b>can</b> it?</p>
      </div>

      <p>Listen to the intonation of these tags. When the tag questions are really questions, the voice goes up at the end.</p>

      <p>But when the tag question is not really a question, the voice goes down at the end.</p>
      <audio controls>

      </audio>

      <p>Often, question tags are not really questions that expect an answer. They are ways of inviting the other person to comment and so to keep the conversation open.</p>

      <h3>Practice</h3>

      <p>Add question tags to the end of these statements. Should your voice go up or down?</p>

      <ol>
        <li>You come from Poland originally, _____ ___?</li>
        <li>We've met before, _______ __?</li>
        <li>I won't see you next week, ____ _?</li>
        <li>You were going to go to class last week, _______ ___?</li>
        <li>He hasn't been studying English very long, ___ __?</li>
        <li>I shouldn't miss too many English classes, ______ _?</li>
        <li>He works as a mechanic, _______ ___?</li>
      </ol>
