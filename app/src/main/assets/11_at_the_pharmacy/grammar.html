      <h3>Present perfect continuous</h3>

      <p>There is a tense in English that we use to talk about a continuous action that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Started in the past</li>
        <li>Is still continuing in the present OR has recently stopped</li>
        <li>Has a connection with the present time.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This tense is called the <i>present perfect continuous</i>.</p>

      <div class="example">
        <p>Pharmacist: Have you been spending time outside?</p>
        <p>Erica: Yes, I’ve been going to the park a lot.</p>
      </div>

      <p>To form the present perfect continuous, take the present tense of <b>have + been + present participle</b> (verb+ing).</p>

      <div class="example">
        <p>It<b>’s been getting</b> worse.</p>
        <p>My eyes <b>have been watering</b>.</p>
      </div>
