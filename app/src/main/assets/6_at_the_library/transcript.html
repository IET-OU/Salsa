        <p>I was <a href="vocab.html#pass_by">passing by</a> the library on Wednesday and I thought I would <a href="vocab.html#drop_in">drop in</a> to <a href="vocab.html#enquire">enquire</a> about joining. I am interested in joining the library because it will help with learning English and because I hear the library has activities for little ones like Maria.</p>

        <p>“Good morning,” I said to the woman at reception. “I was just passing by and I was wondering how I could join the library. What do I need to do?”</p>

        <p>“Of course,” she said. “We always welcome new members. To <a href="vocab.html#register">register</a> we will need to see some ID and <a href="vocab.html#proof_of_address">proof of address</a> from the last 3 months.”</p>

        <p>I said, “Ok, I can do that. I had to do that when I <a href="vocab.html#register">registered</a> on my ESOL course as well.”</p>

        <p>“Oh, you’re on an ESOL course, are you?” she asked. “Then you don’t need to give us ID again. You just need to give us the confirmation letter from your course.”</p>

        <p>“So you mean I don’t have to bring in my ID or proof of address? Is that right?” I asked. “I just need to bring the confirmation letter?”</p>

        <p>She said that was right.</p>

        <p>“Great”, I said. “I don’t have it now, but I can bring it by the end of the week.” Then I wanted to know more. “Could I ask you, what do I get with my membership?” I <a href="vocab.html#enquire">enquired</a>. “What services can I use?” </p>

        <p>“Well,” she explained. “Obviously you can <a href="vocab.html#borrow">borrow</a> and reserve <a href="vocab.html#item">items</a> from the library <a href="vocab.html#catalogue">catalogue</a>. You might also be interested in our IT services, including printing, photocopying and scanning. You can use our computers and WiFi as well.”</p>

        <p>“Fantastic,” I said. “That sounds really good because I don’t have a computer or anything like that at home. Oh, I also wanted to ask - doesn’t the library offer activities for families and small children? I have a daughter who is nearly two.”</p>

        <p>“Yes we do indeed,” she said with a smile. “We have a lovely <a href="vocab.html#session">session</a> of <a href="vocab.html#nursery_rhyme">nursery rhymes</a> and songs on Tuesdays from 10am. There are lots of activities for older children as well.”</p>

        <p>“That’s wonderful,” I said. “She will really like the songs. Oh, and can I just check – is it free to join?”</p>

        <p>“Yes, it’s free to join,” she said. “It’s also free to <a href="vocab.html#borrow">borrow</a> and renew items, and you have half an hour of free wifi every day. There is a <a href="vocab.html#charge">charge</a> for other services like computing, but it’s not expensive, don’t worry!”</p>

        <p>“That’s great,” I said, relieved. “So I don’t need to bring money when I come back?”</p>

        <p>“Not at all,” she said. “You and your daughter can go to the baby sessions completely free.”</p>
