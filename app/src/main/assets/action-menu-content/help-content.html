  <h1>Salsa Beacons help</h1>
  <h2>Beacons</h2>
  <p>The Salsa Beacons app is designed to inform you when you're close to a 'Salsa Beacon', this is a device placed somewhere in the environment that transmits a signal identifying itself. The beacon gathers no infomation itself and has no memory of which users' devices have been within range of it.</p>
  <h2>Bluetooth</h2>
  <p>For the app to work it must enable Bluetooth on your device. It does this automatically when it starts. You can still turn Bluetooth off after this so please be aware that the app will stop detecting beacons until such time as you re-enable Bluetooth.</p>
  <h2>What to expect</h2>
  <p>The app stores a list of all the beacons you've been close to and displays this list to you. Each item in the list allows you to tap on it to view some associated content that we hope will be useful to you.</p>
  <p>If you're not viewing the app at the time it detects a beacon it will alert you by vibrating and adding a notice in the notice bar.</p>
  <p>This initial prototype is meant as a proof of concept and so has limited functionality.</p>
  <p>You can distinguish between read and unread items, with unread items appearing in black text whilst read items will be grey.</p>
  <p>If you are out of a beacon's range for 6 hours or more then when the app next picks up the beacon it will show it as a new instance.</p>
