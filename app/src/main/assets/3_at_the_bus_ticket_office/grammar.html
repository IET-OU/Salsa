      <h3>Conditional with 'would' (Conditional 2)</h3>
    
      <p>Read the dialogue again. Look for the sentences with <b>if + would</b>.</p>

      <div class="example">
        <p>e.g. "<b>If</b> you left home at 2pm you <b>would</b> miss the connecting bus."</p>
      </div>

      <p>This is called <b>Conditional 2</b>. In these sentences we talk about the results of things that are not likely to happen. </p>
      
      <div class="example">
        <p>"If you left home at 2pm" = Event (that might not happen)</p>
        <p>"You would miss the connecting bus" = Result </p>
      </div>

      <p>In this case, the event is unlikely because we haven't decided when to leave home yet.</p>
      
      <p>Even though we are thinking about the present or the future, we form Conditional 2 with <b>simple past</b>... <b>would + infinitive</b>.</p>


      <h3>Practice</h3>

      <p>Make complete conditional sentences.</p>

      <div class="vocab">  
        <p><b>Example:</b> get the 2 o'clock bus / arrive on time</p>
        <p class="example">If I got the 2 o'clock bus I would arrive on time</p>
      </div>
    

      <ol>
        <li>take the number 1 bus / it be faster</li>
        <li>buy the tickets now / it be cheaper</li>
        <li>flight delayed/it be tight</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Conditional 1 vs conditional 2</h3>

      <p>Read the dialogue again and think about the following sentences.</p>

      <div class="example">
        <p>A: If I miss it, can I get the next one?</p>
        <p>B: If I missed it, could I get the next one?</p>
      </div>

      <p>What do you think the two sentences mean? What is the difference?</p>
