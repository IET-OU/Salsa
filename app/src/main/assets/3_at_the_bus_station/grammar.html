      <h2>3 Grammar</h2>

      <h3>Conditional with 'would'</h3>
    
      <p>Read the dialogue again. Look for the sentences with <b>if + would</b>.</p> 
      <p class="example">“If you left home at 2pm you would miss the connecting bus.”</p>

      <p>This is called 'Conditional 2'. In these sentences we talk about the results of things that are not likely to happen. </p>
      
      <p class="example">If you left home at 2pm </p><span class="label">Event (that might not happen)</span><br>
      <p class="example">You would miss the bus </p><span class="label">Result</span>

      <p>In this case, the event is unlikely because we haven't decided when to leave home yet.</p>
      
      <p>Even though we are thinking about the present or the future, we form Conditional 2 with the <b>simple past and would + infinitive</b>.</p>


      <h4>Practice</h4>

      <p>Make complete conditional sentences.</p>
      
      <p class="example"><b>Example:</b> get the 2 o'clock bus / arrive on time
      <br>
      <b>Answer:</b> If I got the 2 o'clock bus I would arrive on time</p>
    

      <ol>
        <li>take the number 1 bus / it be faster</li>
        <li>buy the tickets now / it be cheaper</li>
        <li>flight delayed/it be tight</li>
      </ol>

      <h5>Answers</h5>

      <ol>
        <li>If I took the number 1 bus, it would be faster</li>
        <li>If I bought the tickets now, it would be cheaper</li>
        <li>If my flight was delayed, it would be tight </li>
      </ol>

    
    
      <h3>Conditional 1 vs conditional 2</h3>

      <p>Read the dialogue again and think about the following sentences.</p>
      
      <ol type="A">
        <li>If I miss it, can I get the next one?</li>
        <li>If I missed it, could I get the next one?</li>
      </ol>

      <p>What do you think the two sentences mean? What is the difference?</p>

      <h5>Answer</h5>

      <p>The speaker in the second sentence uses Conditional 2 (simple past + would + infinitve)  because the event is more unlikely to happen. </p>
