      <h2>3 Grammar</h2>

      <h3>Conditional with 'would'</h3>
    
      <p>Read the dialogue again. Look for the sentences with <b>if + would</b>.</p>
           <div class="example">  
      <p>&#147;If you left home at 2pm you would miss the connecting bus.&#148;</p>
      </div>

      <p>This is called &#39;Conditional 2&#39;. In these sentences we talk about the results of things that are not likely to happen. </p>
      
      <p><div class="example">
If you left home at 2pm
</div>
Event (that might not happen)</p>

 <p><div class="example">
You would miss the bus
</div>
Result</p>

      <p>In this case, the event is unlikely because we haven't decided when to leave home yet.</p>
      
      <p>Even though we are thinking about the present or the future, we form Conditional 2 with the <b>simple past and would + infinitive</b>.</p>


      <h3>Practice</h3>

      <p>Make complete conditional sentences.</p>

      <h4>Example</h4>
      
        <p>0.  get the 2 o'clock bus / arrive on time<br />
	If I got the 2 o'clock bus I would arrive on time</p>
    

      <ol>
        <li>take the number 1 bus / it be faster</li>
        <li>buy the tickets now / it be cheaper</li>
        <li>flight delayed/it be tight</li>
      </ol>

      <h4>Answers</h4>
      <ol class="answers">
        <li>If I took the number 1 bus, it would be faster</li>
        <li>If I bought the tickets now, it would be cheaper</li>
        <li>If my flight was delayed, it would be tight </li>
      </ol>

    </div>
    
<h3>Conditional 1 vs conditional 2</h3>

<p>Read the dialogue again and think about the following sentences.</p>
<p>
A: If I miss it, can I get the next one?<br ?>
B: If I missed it, could I get the next one?</p>
		

<p>What do you think the two sentences mean? What is the difference?</p>

<h4>Answer</h4>
<p>The speaker in the second sentence uses Conditional 2 (simple past + would + infinitve)  because the event is more unlikely to happen. </p>
