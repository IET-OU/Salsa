      <p><b>Erica</b>: Hi, I'd like to get from Bletchley to Luton Airport on Friday afternoon. What would you <a href="vocab.html#recommend">recommend</a>? Is it complicated?</p>

      <p><b>Ticket officer</b>: Ok let me see. So, by bus <a href="vocab.html#you_had_best">you had best</a> get the number 1 into Central Milton Keynes, then <a href="vocab.html#hop_on">hop on</a> the number 99 long distance bus to Luton Airport.</p>

      <p><b>Erica</b>: That sounds alright, I'll do that. How long does it take? If I left at two o'clock, what time would I arrive?</p>

      <p><b>Ticket officer</b>: It takes 50 minutes to Luton, but if you left home at 2pm you would miss the connecting bus at 2.10. You would get to Luton at four o'clock. Would that be early enough?</p> 

      <p><b>Erica</b>: I would rather arrive earlier actually. When should I leave if I want to get the earlier <a href="vocab.html#connection">connection</a>?</p>

      <p><b>Ticket Officer</b>: I recommend you take the bus at five past one from Bletchley. That would get you to Central Milton Keynes in <a href="vocab.html#plenty_of_time">plenty of time</a> for the 2:10 bus to Luton.</p>

      <p><b>Erica</b>: Ok, so five past one from Bletchley, then 2:10 to Luton. Oh hang on, what about the return? I'm coming back on a Saturday evening. What times are the buses?</p> 

      <p><b>Ticket Officer</b>: There's a bus at 19:05. Will you make that?</p>

      <p><b>Erica</b>: I'm not sure. <a href="vocab.html#it_will_be_tight">It will be tight</a> if my flight is delayed. If I miss it, can I get the next one?</p>

      <p><b>Ticket Officer</b>: Yes you can get on the next one. Watch out though, there is a <a href="vocab.html#reduced_service">reduced service</a> on Saturday so the last bus is at 20:05. Don't miss that one!</p>

      <p><b>Erica</b>: No I can't miss that one! So can I buy a ticket on the bus or should I buy one now?</p>

      <p><b>Ticket Officer</b>: You could buy it on the bus, but the cheapest way would be to buy a return ticket now. It will save you 10%.</p>

      <p><b>Erica</b>: Ok, sounds great. I'll buy it now then, please!</p>
